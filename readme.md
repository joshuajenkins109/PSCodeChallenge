What works

- Choosing size highlights selected letter
- '+' or '-' to Quantity increases/decreases number as well as listed price (with the min being a quantity of 1) 
- Image Slider (sort of) I quickly snipped photos from the image as i don't have photoshop so the
    images came out a little weird




Future Improvements (things I would have liked to do with a few hours) 
- with access to photoshop, I would have the assets and a more detailed view of designs (font sizes and types). Using just an image of the site was a challenge.
- currently the size selection is not accessible through tabbing
- add functionality to the navigation bar to switch the content of the page (about, contact form, ect.)
- add funtionality to related products (clicking product opens it up in the main content view above)
- fill in the placeholders
- build with react to help manage the state of components such as currently selected size or number of items in the cart
- spend more time making all the components more aesthetically pleasing
